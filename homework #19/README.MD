For this homework assignment, choose one of the other bundlers from that list, and dive into their documentation. Spend some time learning how to use it, and then prepare a brief presentation explaining how the bundler works, what you like about it, and what use-case it's a good fit for.

Your presentation can take any form: a powerpoint, prezi, keynote, pdf, etc. It's up to you!

Extra Credit:

Similar to the above, we spent a long time talking about Gulp, but Grunt is also a good choice. For extra credit, learn how to use Grunt and prepare a separate presentation on that topic. Your presentation should focus on comparing and contrasting Gulp and Grunt, and explaining which use-cases both are good for.
